# Module-6-Methods-and-Functions-in-Python

### Repository Overview

This repository contains my notes and project files for the sixth module of a Python 'bootcamp' I completed as part of my independent learning. This was an in-depth Udemy course with multiple video lectures and exercises, to be completed in a Jupyter environment. This repository includes my notes on the videos for this module, slides from the lectures, and the project .ipynb files.
